This was straightforward, but required us to be clever to implement various parallel algorithms.  Fortunately, for certain classes of algorithms various big data projects have already done this work for us.  Dealing with tabular data like the data in our NYC-Taxi dataset is well covered by many systems like SQL databases, Spark, and Dask.dataframes.\n",
